# SBA-Loan-Analysis

Title: Loan Performance Analysis - Data Requirements
Introduction:

  As part of our ongoing commitment to strategic decision-making and risk management, we are seeking a comprehensive analysis of our loan portfolio   performance. To facilitate this analysis, we are enlisting the expertise of a data analyst to extract meaningful insights from our loan data. The primary focus will be on understanding the overall loan performance, identifying patterns, and discerning trends over time and across different states.

Objective:

  The primary objective is to answer the following questions:

1. Overall Loan Performance:
   
    - What is the overall performance of the loans?
    - How many loans were paid in full (PIF)?
    - How many loans were charged off (CHGOFF)?
    
2. Patterns and Trends:
    - Are there any patterns or trends in loan performance over time or across different states?
